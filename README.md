A Node.js package that adds a realistic human typing simulation to pages using Puppeteer and Ghost Cursor. This package is useful for enhancing web automation scripts by making interactions with pages more human-like.

## Installation

Install the package using npm:

```bash
npm install humanisets
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialize Puppeteer Browser

```js
const { Browser } = require("puppeteer");
const { createCursor } = require("ghost-cursor");
const { humanise } = require("humanisets");

const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
```

## 2. Add Human Typing to the Browser

### Use the humanise function to add human typing functionality to the browser:

```js
await humanise(browser);
```

## 3. Utilize the `humanType` Method

### Now, you can use the `humanType` method on any page in the browser to simulate human-like typing behavior:

```js
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");
await page.humanType("#inputField", "Hello, world!");
```

## Features

- Simulates realistic human typing behavior.
- Adds a convenient humanType method to Puppeteer pages.
- Enhances web automation scripts for more human-like interactions.

## How It Works

The `humanise` function listens for new pages created in the browser. When a new page is detected, it adds the `humanType` method to the page, allowing you to easily simulate human typing.

The `humanType` method utilizes [ghost-cursor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghost-cursor) to move the cursor to the specified input field, click it, and then type the provided text with occasional simulated mistakes, creating a more human-like typing pattern.
